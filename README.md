# Skin-Disease-Identification-System
Skin disease identification involves diagnosing skin conditions by analyzing visible signs like rashes, lesions, or discolorations. AI models now assist in early, accurate detection, improving treatment outcomes and making healthcare more accessible.                                                                                                                                                                                           
Step 1 : Need an Dataset HAM10000 dataset to train the model.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Step 2 : Install the libraries if not installed.(on cmd - pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn pillow
)
Step 3 : put all the code and first train the model.
cmd - python backend/model/train_model.py

Setp 4 : Then Run the app.py to start the server.
step 5 : After run the HTML code by double clicking it.
