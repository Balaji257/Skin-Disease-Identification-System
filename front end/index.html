    const diseaseDescriptions = {
  "Melanocytic nevi": "Melanocytic neviBenign nevi are usually a single color, ranging from skin-colored to dark brown.<br> They are typically round or oval-shaped. In addition, benign moles are symmetric, that is, when a line is drawn within them, the two halves have the same appearance.<br> Most melanocytic nevi are the size of a pencil eraser or smaller. When larger in size, they may be referred to as atypical nevi or they may represent moles present since birth (congenital nevi).<br About 1 in 100 babies are born with a congenital nevus.",
  "Melanoma": "Melanoma is a kind of skin cancer that starts in the melanocytes. Melanocytes are cells that make the pigment that gives skin its color. The pigment is called melanin.Melanoma typically starts on skin that's often exposed to the sun. This includes the skin on the arms, back, face and legs. Melanoma also can form in the eyes. Rarely, it can happen inside the body, such as in the nose or throat.",
  "Benign keratosis-like lesions": "A seborrheic keratosis is a non-cancerous (benign) skin tumour that originates from cells, namely keratinocytes, in the outer layer of the skin called the epidermis. Like liver spots, seborrheic keratoses are seen more often as people age.The tumours (also called lesions) appear in various colours, from light tan to black. They are round or oval, feel flat or slightly elevated, like the scab from a healing wound, and range in size from very small to more than 2.5 centimetres (1 in) across.",
  "Basal cell carcinoma": " Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma begins in the basal cells ‚Äî a type of cell within the skin that produces new skin cells as old ones die off.Basal cell carcinoma often appears as a slightly transparent bump on the skin, though it can take other forms. ",
  "Actinic keratoses / Intraepithelial carcinoma": " Intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common superficial form of keratinocyte cancer. It is also known as Bowen disease, intraepidermal carcinoma (IEC) and carcinoma in situ (SCC in situ).Intraepidermal SCC is derived from squamous cells, the flat epidermal cells that make keratin, the horny protein that makes up skin, hair and nails.‚ÄòIntraepidermal‚Äô and ‚Äòin situ‚Äô mean the malignant cells are confined to the tissue of origin, in this case, the epidermis.",
  "Vascular lesions": " Vascular lesions are abnormal growths or malformations involving blood vessels, categorized as either vascular tumors or vascular malformations. Vascular tumors are true neoplasms, potentially benign, locally aggressive, or malignant. Vascular malformations, on the other hand, are congenital defects in vessel development, including capillary, venous, arteriovenous, and lymphatic malformations.",
  "Dermatofibroma": "Dermatofibromas are typically asymptomatic but may sometimes cause pain, tenderness, or itchiness. Diagnosis involves histopathological examination, which correlates well with sonographic findings. Treatment is generally unnecessary unless the lesion is symptomatic, though excision is recommended for suspicious or atypical cases. Complications of surgical removal may include bleeding, infection, and scarring.",
  "Acne": "Acne is a common skin condition that occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells.Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages.",
  "Psoriasis": "Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease characterized by raised, red, scaly patches, most commonly on the elbows, knees, scalp, and trunk. It's an autoimmune condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks the skin, causing skin cells to multiply too quickly, leading to inflammation and plaque formation. ",
  "Eczema": "Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is an inflammatory skin condition that causes dry, itchy, and inflamed skin."
};


const diseasetreatments = {
  "Melanocytic nevi": "The majority of congenital melanocytic nevi do not need treatment.Check the mole(s) each month. Watch for any changes in the way the mole(s) look. It may help to take a photo of the mole(s) with your smartphone or digital camera so you can tell if there have been any changes.",
  "Melanoma": "Treatment of stage I melanoma is usually surgery to remove the tumor and some of the normal tissue around it, with or without lymph node mapping and removal of lymph nodes.Use any clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. General information about clinical trials is also available.",
  "Benign keratosis-like lesions": " Medical reasons for removing seborrheic keratoses include irritation and bleeding. They may also be removed for cosmetic reasons.[4][5] Generally, lesions can be treated with electrodesiccation and curettage, or cryosurgery. When correctly performed, removal of seborrheic keratoses will not cause much visible scarring.",
  "Basal cell carcinoma": " Treatment is clinical assessment of the lesion and appropriate treatment. Treatments include prescription creams or surgery to remove the cancer. In some cases radiation therapy may be required.",
  "Actinic keratoses / Intraepithelial carcinoma": "As the risk of invasive SCC is low, it may not be necessary to remove all lesions, particularly in elderly patients. Keratolytic emollients containing urea or salicylic acid may be sufficient to improve symptoms. Solitary lesions can be cut out, and the defect repaired by stitching it up. Excision is often recommended if there is suspicion of invasive SCC.",
  "Vascular lesions": "there is no way to get treatment on your own. Vascular lesion treatment typically involves a combination of approaches, including laser therapy, sclerotherapy, surgical excision, and in some cases, medical management with beta-blockers or embolization. The best treatment method depends on the type, location, and size of the lesion, as well as the presence of any associated symptoms or complications",
  "Dermatofibroma": "A dermatofibroma is harmless and seldom causes any symptoms. Usually, only reassurance is needed. If it is nuisance or causing concern, the lesion can be removed surgically. Recurrence is common as the lesion often extends beyond the clinical margin.",
  "Acne": "Acne treatment typically involves a combination of approaches, ranging from over-the-counter products like benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid to prescription medications like antibiotics, retinoids, and oral isotretinoin.",
  "Psoriasis": "Psoriasis treatment aims to slow down rapid skin cell growth, reduce inflammation, and relieve symptoms like itching and scaling. Treatments range from topical creams and ointments for mild cases to systemic medications like oral pills or injections for moderate to severe conditions",
  "Eczema": "Treatment of atopic dermatitis may start with regular moisturizing and other self-care habits. If these don't help, your health care provider might suggest medicated creams that control itching and help repair skin. These are sometimes combined with other treatments."
